# Strategic-Logistics-Optimization-Pyomo-Powered-Delivery-Route-Optimization-Across-Wisconsin-Cities
In this impactful project, I harnessed the power of optimization techniques and Python's Pyomo library to address the complex logistical challenge of optimizing delivery routes across five cities in Wisconsin. By integrating real-time data from the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, I successfully identified the shortest path that covers all cities and facilitates a streamlined return journey. This endeavor showcases my adeptness in operations research, Python programming, and leveraging external APIs for real-world problem-solving.

Key Features:

Route Optimization with Pyomo:

Employed Pyomo, a powerful optimization library in Python, to model and solve the delivery route optimization problem efficiently.
Utilized mathematical modeling techniques to represent constraints and objectives, ensuring an optimal solution for the delivery routes.
Real-Time Data Integration:

Leveraged the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to fetch real-time data on distances and travel times between cities.
Ensured the optimization model adapts dynamically to changes in traffic conditions, providing accurate and up-to-date route planning.
TSP Optimization Technique:

Applied the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) optimization technique to find the most efficient route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting point.
Balanced the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy to deliver a solution that meets practical constraints.
Excel Version for Accessibility:

Developed an Excel version of the optimization model, providing accessibility for users who prefer a familiar interface.
Enabled stakeholders to interact with the model and explore different scenarios for route optimization.
